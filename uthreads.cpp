 * Description: This function initializes the thread library.
 * You may assume that this function is called before any other thread library
 * function, and that it is called exactly once. The input to the function is
 * the length of a quantum in micro-seconds. It is an error to call this
 * function with non-positive quantum_usecs.
 * Return value: On success, return 0. On failure, return -1.
